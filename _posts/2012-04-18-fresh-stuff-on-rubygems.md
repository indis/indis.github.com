The toolset of indis has stabilized, as of now there are three tools:

 * indis-seg provides info on mach-o segments and sections;
 * indis-nm provides a "nm -m" like functionality;
 * indis-dis provides a function disassembly and analysis (most fun of all three).

The gems have been stabilized and released to rubygems. Have fun!
